//to get the appearance of a TV screen, you should place a plane in front off a television model and drag a movie file onto it to create a movie texture. Sometimes times the audio from the file will not play along with the video, so you will have to also drag a seperate audio file onto the plane. The plane should also have an invisible child object attached to it that will be used to trigger the movie to play. All sources and textures mentioned in this file should be dragged onto the plane.
